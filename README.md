Automatic detection of skin lesion shape asymmetry, color variegation and diameter in dermoscopic images.
An empirical approach has been presented to remove variability in quantifying dissymmetry and color variegation, as well as to potentially prevent losing melanoma identification in initial stage due to a diameter being less than 6mm. In summary, this research proposes a segmentation approach that performs better than conventional segmentation approaches, a dissymmetry measure comprised of a SIFT similarity, projection profiles, and unbiased approaches that defines the number of potentially malicious colors in a skin lesion as well as its diameter.
